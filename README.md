This was the first program i've ever written. This was a stretch project I had for my A-levels in year 12. It required that i programmed any application and write a document based on the program. Due to my interest in videogames I decided i would make a game based on fighting games. With no prior experience actually proramming and only previously learning how to coud, I was recommended to use Godot as the engine by a friend as he believed it would be quick for me to learn in my 6 month time limit.
