1.1> Fixed the angle for Down B

1.2> Fixed alot of hitboxes and animations that just didnt make wolf 100% Accurate. These include Up Special, Up Smash. Ftilt, Up Air, Fspecial, and Fair. Hopefully this fixes any issues that would make this wolf seem less than 100% Accurate.

1.3> Fixed damage output on down strong

1.4> Added a tipper to down strong

1.5> Fixed and replaced some costumes

1.6> Fixed some bugs, fixed up tilts hitbox, and fixed the angle of side b

1.7> Made fair and uair attack with his claws instead of feet, added propper abyss rune support, and made uspecial have a shorter wind up time

1.8> Gave him a new alt colour that is the same scheme as his brawl version, as well as made his blastershots green for that alt. Changed the fox and falco alts to have red blastershots now."
